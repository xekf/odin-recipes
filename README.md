# The Odin Project - Recipes
---

This project is from my learing process in *The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/about)*.

It's a simple HTML project to practice the HTML knowledge I've learned so far.

In this project, I will try my best to build a basic recipe website, and I'll do it only with HTML technics. 

According to the requirements from the project, there will be 1 homepage and 3 recipe pages. So, I will include some links and pictures in this website using HTML technics. Oh, almost forget lists should be also included in since it's for food recipes (how could we learn to make food without list of steps in a recipe? Haha).

Okay, that is pretty much everything about this project. Let's do it.
